This project aims to examine how production of research on climate change and disease has evolved from 2005 to 2024, whether it is properly funded, how GDP and the frequency of climate disasters influence it, and which countries are underproducing.

Linked are 2 data files and one R code file:
1. climate change data cleaned.xlsx: contains country GDP and climate disasters frequency.
2. pubmed articles.parquet: contains PubMed research papers that mention climate change and at least one disease (from a list of diseases in the GDB study)
3. analysis.R: contains R code to analyze the data and reproduce the results
